STM HTS221
**********

The HTS221 is an ultra-compact sensor for relative humidity and temperature. It includes a sensing element and a mixed signal ASIC to provide the measurement information through digital serial interfaces.

The sensing element consists of a polymer dielectric planar capacitor structure capable of detecting relative humidity variations and is manufactured using a dedicated ST process; more information at `STMicroelectronics dedicated page <http://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/hts221.html>`_
